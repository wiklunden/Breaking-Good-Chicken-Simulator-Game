# Breaking Good

This simple (and slightly cursed) indie game was made using the SDL2 library and was completely programmed using C++.
The main objective with this game is to buy chicken from Los Food (Los Pollos Hermanos copy). You play as Gus Fring, and when you run out of money you can borrow more from Walter White.

How the current version of the game looks so far:
